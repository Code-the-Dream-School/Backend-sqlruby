SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails INNER JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID;

With aliases: 

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS o INNER JOIN Products AS p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,


SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName FROM Employees INNER JOIN
