SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT od.OrderID, pr.ProductName, od.Quantity 
    FROM Products AS pr 
INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od 
    ON od.ProductID = pr.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,


SELECT (em.FirstName || " " || em.LastName) as EmployeeName, 
    od.ProductID, 
    od.Quantity 
FROM Employees AS em 
INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od 
INNER JOIN Orders AS ors 
    ON em.EmployeeID = ors.EmployeeID 
    AND od.OrderID = ors.OrderID;
