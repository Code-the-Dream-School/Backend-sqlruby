SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM Products
  INNER JOIN OrderDetails
  ON Quantity.OrderID = Products.OrderID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, ProductID, Quantity FROM Employees
	LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS OS ON OS.EmployeeID = EmployeeName.EmployeeID
    OUTER JOIN OrderDetails AS OD ON OD.OrderID = OS.OrderId
    WHERE OrderDetails = Quantity;
