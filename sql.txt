SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderDetails.OrderID, Products.ProductName, OrderDetails.Quantity FROM Products INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;



Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, 
	OrderDetails.ProductID, OrderDetails.Quantity 
FROM
	Employees
	INNER JOIN
      Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID 
   INNER JOIN
      OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID;
