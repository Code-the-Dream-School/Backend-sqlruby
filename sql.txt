SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity
FROM Orderdetails
INNER JOIN Products
ON Orderdetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,



SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, ProductID, Quantity
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN OrderDetails
ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID;
